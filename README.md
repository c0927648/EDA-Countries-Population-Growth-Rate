# EDA-World Population Data from 1970s to 2023

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the World Population Data. The project aims to analyze trends, patterns, and insights into population growth over time across different countries.

## Project Overview

This project uses a dataset containing country population data and their growth rates over the years. The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns, identify outliers, and visualize the data to better understand population dynamics.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on country population and growth rates
- Data visualization using charts and graphs
- Insights and trends based on the population growth rate of different countries

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains the following columns:
- `Country`: Name of the country
- `Year`: Year of data entry
- `Population`: Total population of the country for that year
- `Growth Rate`: Growth rate of the population for that year
